            <h1>- How it works -</h1>
            <p>PLEASE NOTE: This is just beginning, we will be automating & refining this system as we move forward.</p>
            <p>Your input is welcome & appreciated!!</p>

            <p>To help us preserve species,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Email us- <a href="mailto:FreeHeirloomSeeds@gmail.com">FreeHeirloomSeeds@gmail.com</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Type "Species Preservation" in the subject line</li>
                <li>
                    Let us know what varieties of seed you are growing, to save, this season.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Be sure you observe proper isolation distances to avoid cross pollination of your varieties.</p>
                    <p>For a link to a chart on isolation distances.<a href="https://www.seedsavers.org/site/pdf/crop_chart.pdf">CLICK HERE</a> (hint:1600' is more than 5 football fields, opposite sides of the house is not enough for many crops)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Update your seed list with us once a year.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="highlight">More about this program -</h2>
                <p>We will be creating a database of species & people that are growing them.
                Eventually you will be able to look at this list & see how many people are growing a given variety.</p>

                <p>This will help us keep track of varieties that are at risk of disappearing.
                If there is a variety listed that doesn't have anyone growing it, then hopefully community members will step up & help us keep it going.</p>

                <p>In this way we will create a "decentralized" genetic library, which is actually better than a seed vault.</p>

                <p>Being decentralized means that this resource will be spread around & one incident will not threaten catastrophic losses.</p>

                <p>Also by having an active network of seeds growers, we will have fresh, viable seed every year.</p>

                <p>We will also be adding a feature for people to catalog what seeds they have saved & the year of harvest.</p>

                <p>All these elements together should be a solid start on the path to stopping mass extinction on our planet.</p>

                <p>Thanks so much for taking part in preserving our heritage & protecting the future.</p>
