            <p>You may request one ENVELOPE per year (no parcels) to be sent to destinations outside the USA, that are served by USPS international stamps.</p>
            
            <p>The following rules apply -</p>

        <ol>
            <li> The importer, requesting seed, is responsible for knowing & complying with the current requirements to import seeds to your country.</li>
            <li> We cannot send seeds from our oversized list outside of the US.</li>
            <li> You must follow all the rules/guidelines on our <a href="index.html#fullinformation">Main Page</a>, as well as this page.</li>
            <li> Seeds sent outside of the US are not tracked & sent at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Requests that are not accompanied with our suggested minimum donation, must say "no donation" in the email subject line</li>
            <li> One international envelope per requestor or address per year.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Suggested minimum donation for International requests is $5 USD per envelope with up to 8 packs of seed that are NOT ON OUR OVERSIZED LIST</p>
        <p>Please note, we can't always fit 8 packs in an enevelope. (for example: if you choose all watermelon or radish 4 packs is max per envelope)</p>
        <p>International requests are not tracked & sent at your own risk.</p>
        <p>We accept donations through this link -</p>

        <form class="donate__form" action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_top">

        <p>Other countries will likely require at least a phytosanitary certificate to import seeds.</p>
        <p>Envelopes will be marked as having seeds in them & will likely be rejected at the border if your country is not on this list.</p>

        <p>If you do not see your country feel free to search USPS.com to check if your country is served by an international stamp.</p>
        <p>Also check your country for seed importation requirements & restrictions.</p>
        <p>We would love to expand this list.</p>
        <p>We are also looking for international partners to help us start distribution locally in your country.</p>
