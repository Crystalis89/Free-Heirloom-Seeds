            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Free Heirloom Seeds is a grassroots effort to empower individuals & communities with the resources necessary to provide for their basic needs, without chemicals, without corporations & without genetic engineering.</p>

            <p>Through donations we are able to offer free heirloom & open pollinated seeds to the general public.</p>

            <p>This started as a small family project & has quickly grown into an international effort.</p>
            <p>Currently, all our seeds our hand packed by our founder, Michael Reeves, his family & a few volunteers.</p>
            <p>FreeHeirloomSeeds.org is operated out of our retail store, Stone Spirits, In Arcata California.</p>
            <p>We are currently operated as a sole proprietorship until such time as our non profit is stable enough to stand on it's own.</p>

            <p>Donations go to increase our seed stock, seed packing, packing materials & postage.</p>

            <p>It is our hope that through our efforts more people will begin to save seeds-</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring biodiversity on earth.
                <li>Reducing pollution by producing more goods locally & with sustainable practices.
                <li>Increasing planetary health by giving more people affordable access to fresh local foods.
                <li>Reducing the relevance & impact of biotech & corporate "food" producers.
                <li>Empowering individuals & communities to be self sufficient.
            </ul>

            <p>Our seeds are grown by us, donated by individuals & businesses, wildcrafted,
            "grown out" for us by members of our community & purchased from reputable seed packers & producers.</p>
