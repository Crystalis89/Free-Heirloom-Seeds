Template for seed entry. 

Contents on old site template:
	grouped together type of plant (squash(squash), sunflower, beans, ect this part might be just another toggle or separate form)
	seed code
	plant name
	specific cultivar of the plant
	how long to grow to harvest
	short description (should I set a text max?)
	aproximate seeds per request



New additions to template?:
		plant tag (fruit, vegetable, flower, grain).

	
	
	
Freeheirloom seeds, probably wouldn't pay but could do it in trade for seeds as long as nothing fancy but good for practice. Their current site is using table filled with <p> elements for layout, so they likely do it themselves and are at least a decade out of date. Still they are capable of at least basic editing so as long as keep it similarly easy while looking better they might accept it.

Maybe write a simple JS script where he just puts in the plant name, text, and itemcode and it will give him the HTML to paste. Since it would just be a  few simple form.values slotted into a simple template it shouldnt take much and could probably just have it hosted on github or just a hidden page. Add a few options he can toggle to control styling via adding classes like font color. Maybe include option for them to include an information link. If possible including a letter class to position it in proper place in the list?

On my end that would be more complicated initially but on theirs would remove the need to code entirely and just become copy/paste.

Also to aid navigation a simple set of links for alphabetic navigation.

Hello I heard about your site when searching seeds and after browsing it decided to update your site as a learning project. Visually it mostly the same just making it look a bit more polished/modern and adding some alphabetic navigation, on backend it using more modern code that let it scale better and be more accessible. 

But to make adding easier to whoever doing it now I also wrote a simple tool where you just fill in the data in the template and it will give you the code to paste which also let you customize things a bit more with a simple checkbox click. I didn't include ability to add or remove things directly for security reasons.

I know you are a small charity so not going to ask for payment since I did this for learning and to help, but I wouldn't say no to some seeds. I am very new to gardening without much good soil so whatever you think is the easiest to germinate/lowest maintinence in Pennsylvania (zone 6b), I would be happy with most anything just out of curiosity.


Quick math say 2 weeks at average of 3 hours a day and minimum wage of $8 would come out to roughly $360.
