                <p>Requests without donations are prioritzed to those that cannot afford our suggested donation. If we had the resources to provide additional packs of seed with our suggested donation then we would set it at $10 for 20 packs or more. Unfortunately costs for us are rising, but, thankfully, we have been able to keep our suggested donation the same for the last few years.</p></li>

                <li class="fullinformationlist__item"><p> If you donated & did not follow our request instructions please expect at least one less pack, mispicks or other inconsistencies.

                    If you request online or by mail, include some backup varieties in case we are out of something.
                    We want to send you seeds you will use, so please choose from the list.
                    At times, we have hundreds of different vairieties of seed available & they are not all for everyone.
                    You must choose seeds from our list!! Orders without seeds selected tell us these seeds & this service is being taken for granted.

                        <li>Please don't copy & paste the whole description, we have to read through the list & sometimes we have to read it 3 or 4 times to see if we missed something in the paragraphs of descriptions, which wastes our time & threatens the sustainability of this program.</li>

                        <li>Requests that are not in alphabetical order are very dificult to fill & should expect some mispicks.</li>

                        <li>If seeds are not in rows of 10 we have to walk back to the screen & scroll, sometimes multiple times to fill a request.</li>
                        <li>Please show some kindness for our seed packers & list your codes in rows of 10.</li>
                        <li>Please send us a complete address, including zip code.</li>

                        <li>Email should include the name you used in your paypal account if you made a donation to avoid confusion & help us prioritize your request.</li>
